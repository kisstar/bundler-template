## How to download one of them?

Here we briefly introduce two schemes.

### GUI

Select the folder path you need and download it through [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home).

### Command Line

```bash
git init <repo>
cd <repo>
git remote add origin <url to remote repo>
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "dir/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin master
```

You can refer to the following examplesï¼š

```bash
git init webpack-basis
cd webpack-basis
git remote add origin https://github.com/dongwanhong/hello-world.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "webpack-basis" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin master
```

## How do you use it?

Rename the downloaded folder to your package name, and change the "package-name" to your package name.
